# **Theoretical Social Media App Description:**
You are tasked with designing a social media app where users can share photos, videos, and text-based posts, connect with friends, and discover content. The app features a personalized feed that displays posts from the user’s friends and followed accounts. Users can interact with posts by liking, commenting, and sharing them. The app also includes profile pages where users can view and edit their personal information, manage their posts, and customize their privacy settings.

## **Background:**
After reviewing the description of the theoretical fitness tracking app design, you identify some UX issues. The home screen of the app displays a cluttered interface with overwhelming information, making it difficult for users to focus on their fitness goals. Additionally, the navigation structure lacks clarity, and the interaction design for tracking activities is not intuitive. Based on these issues, you decide to simplify the layout, improve the visual hierarchy, and make the interactions more user-friendly.

To address these issues, you would make the following design improvements:

- Simplify the home screen layout by reducing visual noise, decluttering unnecessary information, and focusing on the key fitness goals and progress. This would create a clearer and more motivating interface for users.
- Enhance the visual hierarchy by prioritizing important elements such as the user’s daily activity summary, goal progress, and personalized recommendations. This would help users quickly access the most relevant information.
- Improve the interaction design by introducing clear and intuitive icons and buttons for tracking activities, such as running, cycling, or weightlifting. Providing real-time feedback during activity tracking, such as distance covered or calories burned, would further engage users.
- Streamline the navigation by implementing a clear and intuitive menu structure, allowing users to easily access features like activity tracking, goal setting, and progress history. This would enhance the overall usability and ease of exploration within the app.

You would then describe these improvements in detail, explaining how each improvement aligns with the applied UX principles and how they would enhance the user experience in a fitness tracking context.

By making these design improvements, users would find it easier to track their fitness activities, stay motivated, and achieve their fitness goals. The simplified layout, improved visual hierarchy, and intuitive interactions would enhance the overall user experience, making the app more enjoyable and effective for users in their fitness journey.


## **Identifying UX Issues:**

1. **Complex Interface:** The personalized feed that displays posts from the user’s friends and followed accounts may become cluttered and overwhelming, leading to difficulties in focusing on relevant content.

2. **Inconsistent Interaction Design:** The interaction design for liking, commenting, and sharing posts should be consistent throughout the app to provide a smooth user experience.

3. **Unintuitive Post Management:** The description does not mention how users can easily manage their posts, such as editing or deleting them.

4. **Unclear User Settings:** The app needs to provide clear and easily accessible options for users to customize their settings, as this is crucial for their comfort and security.


**Applying UX Principles:**

1. **Simplicity:** Simplify the app's interface by reducing visual clutter and presenting information in a clear and organized manner. 

2. **Consistency:** Ensure consistent interaction design throughout the app for actions like liking, commenting, and sharing posts.

3. **Feedback and Response:** Give users clear feedback on their actions, such as successful post shares, an clearly error alert from an specific action


## **Design Improvements:**

1. **Streamlined Feed Interface:** Implement a card-based layout for the feed, displaying each post as an individual card with prominent visuals. The cards will have options for liking, commenting, and sharing. Additionally, introduce a filter option to allow users to sort the feed based on different criteria like most recent, most liked, or trending. (inspiration on Facebook)

2. **Consistent Interaction Design:** Use familiar icons and buttons for actions like liking, commenting, and sharing across the app. Keep the placement and design of these elements consistent to provide a seamless user experience. taking in mind that our target is a user who knows about social media and knows other apps, so the common icons would be in the most popular apps from the market

3. **Intuitive Post Management:** Allow users to manage their posts by incorporating an "Edit" and "Delete" option within the post itself. 

4. **Clear User Settings:** Place a dedicated "User settings" section in the user profile settings. Inside this section, users can easily customize their settings


## **Additional Insights and Considerations:**

1. **User Onboarding:** Add a user-friendly onboarding process that guides new users through setting up their profiles, finding friends, and discovering content. Consider offering a tutorial or interactive guide for new users to understand the app's features.

    1.1. **Copy From Market Leaders** Maybe an onboarding flow is not neccessary, because social media apps are very common on this days, so, using same icons or same UI distribution from importants app leaders from the market could be nice to avoid the learning curve

2. **Push Notifications:** If there are not implemented yet, push notifications to keep users engaged by notifying them about new posts from friends, replies to their comments, and trending topics.

3. **Tracking Events** Adding events to specific action buttons could give feedback on users' interaction with features and take this in mind for decisions.
